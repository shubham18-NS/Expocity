🏙️ What is EXPOCITY?

Think of EXPOCITY as a “city helper app” for people who are new in town.

Example: You visit Pune for the first time. You don’t know where to find:

Hospitals 🏥

Lodges/PGs 🛏️

Food 🍔

ATMs 💰

Tourist spots 🌆

Instead of asking random strangers, you open EXPOCITY → it shows you everything nearby with maps, reviews, and recommendations.

🔹 What does it need to do? (Step by Step)
1. Find where you are 📍

The app asks your location → then shows important places around you.

2. Show useful categories 🗂️

Hospital

Food

Lodges

ATMs

Tourist places

You just tap the category → it shows you nearby options.

3. Details of a place 🔎

Click on a hospital → you see:

Rating from other people

4. Favorites ❤️

If you like a food spot, you can “save” it to visit later.

5. Recommendations 🧠

If you’re hungry, the app can say: “Here are the top-rated food places near you!”
